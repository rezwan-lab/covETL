# 🧬 SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Toolkit

A comprehensive suite of Python-based tools for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, lineage classification, mutation profiling, and real-time data transformation. This toolkit was instrumental in supporting national and international pandemic response efforts by enabling fast, efficient, and automated analysis of GISAID and Nextstrain metadata at scale.

## 🌐 Introduction

As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, timely genomic surveillance became essential to detect emerging variants, assess mutation trends, and inform public health decisions. With thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences being generated weekly across India and globally, manual curation and analysis became impractical. To address this challenge, we developed a robust and modular toolkit that streamlines the end-to-end workflow—from **Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)** to variant classification and mutation-based reporting.

This toolkit was deployed across multiple genomic surveillance projects, including India's national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance (INSACOG) and BRICS-NGS networks. It was designed to:

- Ingest and normalize high-volume genomic metadata
- Classify lineages into WHO-defined variants (e.g., VOC, VOI, VUM)
- Explode amino acid mutations and group them by gene, position, and effect
- Perform weekly and monthly batch analyses
- Generate Excel and TSV reports for integration with dashboards and government briefings

Whether you're managing a genomic surveillance lab or analyzing global trends for public health insights, this toolkit provides scalable and reproducible workflows for variant monitoring and mutation analytics.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Clean and visualize Nextstrain metadata with lineage classification and mutation statistics.
- 🧬 **Lineage Classification**: Map Pango lineages to WHO-recognized variants using batch logic and ImpLin tagging.
- 🔬 **Mutation Profiling**: Extract, parse, and explode amino acid changes with gene and position-based summaries.
- 📁 **ETL Pipeline Automation**: Fully automated extraction, transformation, and loading of large-scale metadata files.
- 📈 **Pivot Tables & Interactive Reports**: HTML pivot tables, Excel/TSV exports for seamless reporting.
- 🧠 **Batch Processing Support**: Handle high-throughput weekly/monthly batches with reproducible analytics.
